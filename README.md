# What-Your-Heart-Rate-Is-Telling-You
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Researchers are using several data mining techniques to help health care professionals in the diagnosis of heart disease. In this project, you will examine the relationship between the maximum heart rate one can achieve during exercise and the likelihood of developing heart disease. Using multiple logistic regression, you will handle the confounding effects of age and gender.  This project uses the Cleveland heart disease dataset.

# Goals
- 1. Find out the association and correlation between heart disease and several concerned variables
- 2. Build a logistic model to predict the disease
